# Geo Data App

Geo Data App is a web application that allows users to upload GeoJSON or KML files, visualize geographic data on an interactive map, and draw custom shapes on the map. The app also supports downloading the drawn shapes as GeoJSON files.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload GeoJSON or KML files to visualize geographic data on the map.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize the uploaded data on a map with the ability to zoom, pan, and explore the map.
- **Draw Custom Shapes**: Use drawing tools to create custom shapes like polygons and circles directly on the map.
- **Download Drawn Shapes**: After drawing shapes, download them as a GeoJSON file.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality for users.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - React-Leaflet (for displaying maps)
  - Leaflet.js (for map interaction)
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - Redux (for state management)
  - React-Dropzone (for file upload)

- **Backend** (if applicable):
  - Node.js (for server-side logic)
  - Express.js (for API routes)
  - MongoDB (optional, for storing user data)
